# Running Terramate in Automation

One of the most important capabilities of Terramate is to leverage CI/CD platforms such as GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD,
BitBucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps, and others for cost-effective Terraform and OpenTofu automation and collaboration.

This enables you to automate the orchestration of your IaC stacks using GitOps workflows and comes with the following
benefits:

✨ **GitOps for infrastructure**

Move fast using a declarative, single source of truth with an auditable history and change management controls.
Be more productive and reliable. Provide a better Developer Experience by building on top of tools your team already knows.

✨ **Run in any existing CI/CD**

Terramate helps you to achieve the best automation and collaboration experience when working with Terraform and OpenTofu
in any CI/CD. This means you can reuse existing infrastructure, collaboration features, audit logs and security.

✨ **Design your workflows without limitations**

Configure limitless workflows. Whether you prefer merge-and-apply or apply-and-merge; we got you covered.

✨ **Integrate any existing tooling**

Integrate third-party toolings such as infracost, trivy, terrascan, checkov, OPA, Kyverno, Sentinel and others into your workflows.
Terramate allows you to integrate and run any tool.

✨ **Reduce execution time of existing pipelines**

Parallel runs and change detection allows orchestrating stacks containing changes only and running those in parallel.

✨ **No extra budget needed**

Enable cost-effective automation for IaC by integrating with your existing CI/CD instead of paying
for an additional and expensive platform.

✨ **Maximum Security**

Using your existing CI/CD limits the number of privileged platforms in your organization. There's no need to provide an
additional platform with access to your cloud accounts.
